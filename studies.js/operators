-operators- operators are tools in our code to assist coders in diffrent ways. for example if instead on typing concat 
when I want to add to variable in a function I can use the addition operator to shorten my code

-assighnment operators- the assighnment operator adds value to the given variable
'=' -ex- 2 + 2 = x //4
"+=" -ex- 2 += x //6
"-=" -ex- 2 -= x //4
"*=" -ex- 1 *= x //4
"/=" -ex- 2 /= x //2
"%" -ex- 2 %= x // 0
"**=" -ex- 2 **= x// 0

-Arithmetic operators-  arithmetic operator are used like aitmetic equations to help writ code-
'+' - addition 
'-' - subtraction
'*' - multiplication
'**' - exponent
'/' - division
'%' - remainder
'++' - increment
'--' - decrement

-comparison operators- comparision operators are used to compare two values to eachother. the most common is greaterthan/ lessthan
'==' - equals to
'===' - strictly equals
'!=' - not equal
'!===' - strictly not equal
'>' - greater than
'<' - lessthan
'>=' - greater than or equal to
'<=' - less than or equal to

-logical operators- logical operators are used many times in tandom with conditional statements like the rest. for example the and operator is saying 
if (x && x) are truthy return true.
'&&' -  the and operator is used how i descirbed it above
'||" - the or operator is used like the and operator but instead of checking for if both pass it would see if one of the pass.
'!' - the not operator is used many times as a way to check for or say anything that is stricly not this

-tenery operator- this is used as a 'shortcut' for code logic. I like to relate this to the arrow function learned in ES6.
the tenery operator is a way to use conditional statements and check a varibale with diffrent values in you code.
-ex- 
function runmiles(5milesreach) {
  return (5milesreach ? '5' : '3.5');
}
console.log(runmiles(true))// 5
